## The problem

The digital world is a one-way mirror. You only see the images it shows you: the content you consume every day (streaming, social networks, online media), mostly for free. What you don't see is that you are constantly being spied on by algorithms that, by spending days watching you, know you better than you know yourself.

## Our planÂ 

That you break the mirror! The Eyeballs makes the invisible visible: all the traces you leave online that serve to draw up your psychological profile: your flaws, your tastes, the words and images capable of convincing you. We give you the tools to see the digital world as it really is and not as its actors want you to see it.
