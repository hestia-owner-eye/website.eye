  - title: How much is your attention worth?
    description: >-
      Every second you spend online, thousands of sensors track your behaviour.
      The best data experts have designed them to profile you and design the
      message, the image, the video likely to arouse your interest. By any means
      necessary.


      To get your attention, advertisers have spent over US$375 billion on digital media in 2020 alone. 


      How am I targeted? How much am I worth? More or less than my neighbour? Why? Join the Eyeballs and find out what digital sauce you are being eaten with.

  - title: You are influenced
    description: >-
      “No way. I'm not. The only ones who get influenced are the conspiracists
      and the kids on Instagram, not me.” Don't be so sure... Brands and
      political parties use profiling and brain mechanisms to subtly affect your
      opinions and behavior.


      Who is trying to convince you? Of what? What traces did you leave online for them to believe that you are manipulable?


      Join the Eyeballs to understand how you are influenced, compare yourself to the average and see the difference in perception of your profile between the different apps and media you use.
