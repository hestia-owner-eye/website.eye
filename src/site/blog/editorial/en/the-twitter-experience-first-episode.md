Hello, my name is Charles Foucault-Dumas, I'm 39 years old and have very few qualities other than curiosity. So when [HestiaLabs](www.hestialabs.org), for whom I work, decided to support The Eyeballs initiative by developing software tools capable of revealing digital traces each of us leaves online and how they are used to convince us (to buy this, to vote for that...), I immediately raised my finger.

* Can I try?
* Do you want to be a beta tester for The Eyeballs?
* Yes!
* Well, okay. Which social network do you use the most? 
* Twitter.
* So here we go.

The very next day, I learned (not without a little pride) that I was a woman and that I spoke German. I also discovered my interest in the footballer Jérémie Boga (whom I didn't know existed), my passion for Land Rovers (???) and my immoderate taste for milk (I never drink it).

```
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To Read: the thread of <a href="https://twitter.com/LetTweetBe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@lettweetbe</a>, the first of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheEyeballs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheEyeballs</a>, one twitto among many, who just wants to understand what <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Twitter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Twitter</a> knows about him and how that information is used to get his attention. <a href="https://t.co/E8uBYxVnSl">https://t.co/E8uBYxVnSl</a></p>&mdash; The Eyeballs (EN) (@TheEyeballsEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheEyeballsEN/status/1417440984972025857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

But all this is just the tip of the iceberg. Twitter knows a lot more about me. The Eyeballs team is currently developing the software tools to reveal all the things we don't see: why I am the ideal target for this or that advertising campaign. Why I am likely to adhere to this message, to click on this video. All this is about to be ready soon and will be the subject of a future post...
