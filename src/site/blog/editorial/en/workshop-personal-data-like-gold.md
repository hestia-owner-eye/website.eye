  Check out some pictures of the workshop we organized on data collected by
  Facebook and Twitter, in parallel with the one organized by the data
  collective [Dating Privacy](https://dating-privacy.hestialabs.org/) on dating
  apps.


  Thanks to [the tools](/en/tools/) [HestiaLabs](https://hestialabs.org/) developed for The Eyeballs, the participants were able to manipulate the data collected on them by social networks and better understand how it is used to target and influence them.


  They were also able to play with our [AdRadar](https://github.com/hestiaAI/ad-radar/blob/main/README.md) browser extension that displays the price of online ads on ads.

  Thanks to the participants for their involvement, their relevant questions and their feedback.


  See you soon for new workshops.


  In the meantime, if you want to learn more about the data collected about you, feel free to use our tools. We post on this Vimeo page the tutorials to help you.
