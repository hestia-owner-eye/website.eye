lead: Facebook wants to collect data outside its platforms, on the sites and in
  the physical stores of its client-advertisers, for the better? Well, for the
  worse, for users.

In a very detailed [article](https://www.pixeldetracking.com/fr/les-signaux-resilients-de-facebook-ou-comment-la-surveillance-sadapte) (in french), the site pixel tracking describes how Facebook is educating advertisers to explain the benefits of widespread monitoring of the general public (you and me): tracking users on its applications (Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and soon Oculus) but also outside (third-party sites, even offline) allows Facebook to ensure advertisers the revenue they dream of when they design a marketing campaign.

### Money down the drain

Facebook tells advertisers, its customers ([98% of Facebook revenues](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Results/) come from advertising): "Let us observe the behavior of your customers on your websites or even in your stores, this will allow us to know them better (who really buys? who just comes to see? who buys a lot? who buys only a little?) and thus make your campaigns more effective." In short: you'll pay less for the same or even better results because we'll only carry your message to those who we know will come to buy from you after seeing it.

Conversely, Facebook warns advertisers that their campaigns won't work as well if there are holes in the picture: not knowing your customers inside and out, from what attracts them to what they end up buying, will force you to design ad campaigns without all the cards in hand. Inaccurate campaigns that will certainly not be transformed into buying actions. In short, money down the drain.

### Generalized surveillance, everywhere, all the time

But don't worry, Facebook immediately reassures by presenting a free and ready-to-use solution on a silver platter: a brand new toolkit that allows advertisers to send directly to Facebook the behavioral information of their customers online (thus bypassing adblockers), including the filling of a form (name, first name, email, phone number ...) and offline (purchases in stores, loyalty points, calls to the after-sales service ...).

The authors who did the remarkable work of dissecting this document, highlight the main point of bad faith at the end of the article: "Conversion API (editor's note: one of the tools to track customers - even with adblockers - online and offline) is a way to secure data for sensitive sectors (banking, insurance, ...)." It goes without saying that the first thing I would think of if I wanted to keep my sensitive bank account or insurance policy data safe would be to send it to Facebook.
