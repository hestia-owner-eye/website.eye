We are carefully documenting what type of data each company holds about you (only the type of data, never the data itself). The sum of this information is a **data catalog**.

It will facilitate the participatory development of privacy-friendly tools and services around this data. This effort is done in collaboration with [other projects in the HestiaLabs ecosystem](https://hestialabs.org/en/projects/). We all benefit from working together on this. 

You can freely access this catalog [here](https://github.com/hestiaAI/data-catalog).
